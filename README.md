## Claycoins
This is just a stupid little android app I made to expand my horizons on project modules for shared
classes, ktor for the server, exposed for the server database, and jetpack compose for the android app.

While working on this I didn't really care about git, as this is really just something for me to play
around with, so there isn't really a commit history.

The module names are pretty self-explanatory. The app module is the android app code. The claycoins-server
module is the ktor and exposed server. The data module is the shared classes and other utilities for
both the server and app.
